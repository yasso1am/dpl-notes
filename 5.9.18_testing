Testing, 3 main things to cover:

Manual: break software by using it (not covered)
Integration testing: writing an automated test, that will go through the app in different paths to see
            if things are working correctly. QA Automation would write this.
Unit testing: Tests that run around units inside of our application (around a method, etc.)

gem 'rspec' - is one of the most popular testing gems ('rspe/core/rake_task'
gem 'rake' - allows us to run tasks around our application
